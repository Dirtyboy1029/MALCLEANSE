# MALCLEANSE

## Overview
This repository is associated with our FSE'25 paper titled **Mitigating Emergent Malware Label Noise in DNN-Based Android Malware Detection**.
In this paper, we first explore the characteristics of label noise in real-world Android malware datasets, which we refer to as EM label noise. Then, we design this tool to remove EM label noise. We start by assessing the model's uncertainty regarding the samples in the dataset, and based on these uncertainties, we use anomaly detection algorithms to eliminate this label noise.

## Prerequisites:
The codes depend on Python 3.8.10. Before using the tool, some dependencies need to be installed. The list is as follows:

### üìä Noise Types

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Random Noise

- **Example:** `random_1_drebin_10`
- **Explanation:**
  - **`random`**: Indicates that the noise type is **random noise**.
  - **`1`**: Represents the **first experiment** (each experiment is conducted **three times** for stability).
  - **`drebin`**: Specifies the **source dataset**, in this case, the **Drebin dataset**.
  - **`10`**: Indicates the **noise rate** is **10%**.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ EM Noise

- **Example:** `thr_1_18`
- **Explanation:**
  - **`thr`**: Represents **EM noise** (*threshold-based noise*).
  - **`1`**: Represents the **first experiment**.
  - **`18`**: Indicates the **VirusTotal threshold** is set to **18**.

### ‚ö° Usage Examples

```bash
python train.py --noise_type random_1_drebin_10
python train.py --noise_type thr_1_18

      
      model_type: The types of uncertainty estimation models available for our experiments are options "vanilla", "bayesian", "mcdropout", and "deepensemble".

#### 1. Estimate uncertaintyÔºöWe use Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI) to perform 5-fold cross-validation on the dataset with label noise to evaluate the uncertainty of each sample. Specifically, we generate 10 prediction probabilities for each sample. The differences among these 10 prediction probabilities represent the uncertainty for that sample.

     cd Training 

     python train_noise_model.py 


#### 2. Label Noise detectionÔºöWe calculate the average cross-entropy of these 10 prediction probabilities and use it as a quantification metric for uncertainty. Then, using anomaly detection algorithms, the anomalous samples are identified as label noise samples.
